# mern_stack_ecommerce_website

This is an Ecommerce website made with React Js, Node Js, MongoDB and Express JS. React Js is being used for front end development and the Express frame work is being used for backend development and the MongoDB is being used as a database.

I am using REST API here which can be easily made by node js. At first I used Postman for API testing.

MERN stack is one of the popular stack to develop a fast and amazing website. It is my first MERN stack repository. I am learning MERN Stack from a great youtube channel name Lama Dev. Every day I am trying to learn new things from him. I started this project today and will continue until I have become proficient in the stack.
